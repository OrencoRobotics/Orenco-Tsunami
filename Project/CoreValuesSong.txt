We do the work to find solutions with guidance from our coaches and mentors.

We know our coaches and mentors don’t have all the answers; we learn together.

We honor the spirit of friendly competition. Yes we do. 

What we discover is more important than what we win.

We display Gracious Professionalism® and Coopertition® in everything we do.

We share our experiences with others.

We are a team. We have FUN!
